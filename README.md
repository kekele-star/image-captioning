An image captioning system that generates descriptive text for images

# Image Captioning Model README

## Overview

This repository contains an image captioning system that generates descriptive text for images using deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs). The goal of this project is to enhance user experience in image-heavy applications and provide accessibility features for visually impaired users.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kekele-star/image-captioning.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have your image dataset prepared. The dataset should be organized with images and their corresponding captions.

2. Train the image captioning model using the following command:

```bash
python train.py --dataset_path /path/to/your/dataset
```

3. Once the model is trained, you can generate captions for new images using:

```bash
python generate_caption.py --image_path /path/to/your/image.jpg
```

## Model Architecture

The image captioning model consists of two main components:

- **CNN Encoder**: This component extracts features from the input image using a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet, VGG16).

- **LSTM Decoder**: This component generates captions based on the features extracted by the CNN encoder. It is a sequence model that utilizes LSTM units to predict the next word in the caption.

## Dataset

Ensure that your dataset is structured with images and their corresponding captions. Each image should have one or more descriptive captions associated with it.

## Training

During training, the model learns to generate captions for images by minimizing a loss function that measures the dissimilarity between the predicted captions and the ground truth captions.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as BLEU score, METEOR score, or human evaluation based on the quality and relevance of generated captions.
